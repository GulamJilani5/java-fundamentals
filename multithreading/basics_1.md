# ⏺️ 1. Threads, Runnable, Callable, Thread Pool, Future

## 🟦 Threads

- Threads are lightweight processes within a program that allow multiple tasks to run concurrently, utilizing CPU resources efficiently.
- Threads share the same memory space, enabling communication but requiring careful synchronization.
- - Primary two ways to create the thread

#### 🔵 Creating Thread

- Extending the Thread Class

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Starts the thread
    }

}
```

- Override the `run()` method to define the thread's task.
- Call `start()` to initiate the thread (not `run()` which executes in the current thread).

## 🟦 Runnable

- A task that does something but doesn’t return a result. It has a run() method

#### 🔵 Implementing the Runnable Interface (Preferred):

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

- More flexible, as it allows the class to extend another class.
- Pass the Runnable object to a Thread constructor.

## 🟦 Callable

- A task that does something and returns a result. It has a `call()` method.

## 🟦 Future

- An object that holds the result of a `Callable task`, which you can check later.

## 🟦 Thread Pool

- A group of reusable threads managed by the `ExecutorService` to run tasks.

# ➡️ 2. Thread Lifecycle

## A thread in Java goes through several states:

### New:

Thread is created but not started (`new Thread()`).

### Runnable:

Thread is ready to run after `start()` is called; it’s waiting for CPU time.

### Running:

Thread is executing its `run()` method.

### Blocked/Waiting:

##### Blocked:

Thread is waiting for a monitor `lock` (e.g., in a synchronized block).

##### Waiting:

Thread is waiting indefinitely (e.g., `wait()`, `join()`, or `LockSupport.park()`).

##### Timed Waiting:

Waiting with a timeout (e.g., `sleep()`, `wait(timeout)`, or `join(timeout)`).

### Terminated:

Thread has completed execution or was stopped.

## Transitions:

- **start():** New → Runnable.
- **Scheduler assigns CPU:** Runnable → Running.
- **sleep(), wait(), or I/O:** Running → Blocked/Waiting/Timed Waiting.
- **notify() or lock release:** Blocked/Waiting → Runnable.
- **run() completes or exception:** Running → Terminated.
