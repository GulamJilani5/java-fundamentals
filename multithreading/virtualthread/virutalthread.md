# ⏺️ Virtual Thread

A Virtual Thread is a lightweight thread introduced in **Java 19** (as preview) and stabilized in **Java 21** under `Project Loom`. It is a new type of thread that **runs on the JVM** but is much cheaper to create and manage compared to **Traditional Platform (OS) Threads**.

- A **Platform Thread** is a Java thread backed 1:1 by an OS thread.
- A **Virtual Thread** is a Java thread managed mostly by the JVM, not directly tied to an OS thread.
- Thousands (or even millions) of Virtual Threads can run on a limited number of OS threads.
- 🔴**Virtual Threads** are not faster thread, they do not run code any faster than **Plateform Threads**. But They exist to provide `Scale`(**Higher Throughput**) and **Lower Latency**(not speed).

### ➡️ What Problems Do Virtual Threads Solve?

##### 🟦 Traditional threads (platform threads) have limitations(Problems):

- **High memory usage:** Each OS thread takes ~1MB stack memory → thousands of threads = OutOfMemoryError.
- **Expensive context switching:** The OS must frequently swap threads, slowing performance.
- **Blocking I/O inefficiency:** If one thread is blocked on I/O (like DB query, HTTP call), it holds an OS thread unnecessarily.
- **Concurrency bottleneck:** In server apps (e.g., handling 100k requests), platform threads can’t scale.

##### 🟦 Virtual Threads solve this:

- Much lighter (a few KB instead of MB).
- Can create millions without running out of memory.
- JVM handles scheduling, so blocked virtual threads don’t block OS threads.
- Perfect for highly concurrent applications (e.g., web servers, microservices, DB clients).

### ➡️ Where to Use Virtual Threads

- **Web servers** (e.g., Spring Boot, REST APIs) → handle thousands of requests.
- **Microservices** making many external API/DB calls.
- **Event-driven systems** where high concurrency is required.
- **Batch jobs** with parallel processing.

### ➡️ Not Ideal For

- CPU-intensive tasks (use platform threads instead).
- Tight real-time constraints (OS threads are better).
