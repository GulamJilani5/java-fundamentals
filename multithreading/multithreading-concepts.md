## ➡️ 1. Threads and the Thread Class

- Understand what threads are and how to create them using the Thread class or by implementing the Runnable interface.

## ➡️ 2. Thread Lifecycle

- Learn the states of a thread: New, Runnable, Running, Blocked/Waiting, and Terminated, and how transitions occur between these states.

## ➡️ 3. Synchronization

- Explore how to prevent thread interference and ensure data consistency using synchronized methods, blocks, and the synchronized keyword.

## ➡️ 4. Thread Safety

- Understand thread-safe classes and techniques like volatile, Atomic classes, and ReentrantLock.
- volatile resolve the visibility problem

## ➡️ 5. Inter-Thread Communication

- Understand how threads communicate using methods like wait(), notify(), and notifyAll().

## ➡️ 6. Thread Priorities

- Learn how to set thread priorities and how they influence thread scheduling.

## ➡️ 7. Concurrency Utilities (java.util.concurrent)

## ➡️ 8. Deadlocks, Starvation, and Livelocks

- Learn about common multithreading issues and how to avoid them.

## ➡️ 9. Thread Pools

- Understand the importance of thread pools and how to use Executors to manage threads efficiently.

## ➡️ 10. Fork/Join Framework & Parallel Streams

- **Concept:** Splits tasks into subtasks (RecursiveTask/RecursiveAction) for parallel execution.
- **Why Important:** Efficient for large data parallelism.

## ➡️ 11. Virtual Thread
