# ‚è∫Ô∏è Java Concurrency: The Confusion Between Executor and Executors

- Ever wondered ‚Äî "We have an Executor interface and also a class named Executors.
- What‚Äôs the difference?‚Äù - This is one of those Java concurrency confusions that catches even experienced devs!üòÖ.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Executor

- **Executor** ‚Äî The **Interface**.
- **Executor** is a core interface introduced in Java 5.
- It defines a simple contract:

```java
public interface Executor {
void execute(Runnable command);
}
```

- That‚Äôs it! - It just represents something that can run your tasks ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt say how.
- Think of it as a contract for submitting tasks.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Executors ‚Äî The Utility Class

- Provides factory methods to create executors.
- Executors is a factory class that helps you create different types of ExecutorService implementations (thread pools).

```java
Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
```

- Internally, all of these return a `ThreadPoolExecutor`, pre-configured for specific behaviors.
- **ThreadPoolExecutor** -> The real implementation doing the heavy lifting.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Pro Tip:

- In production systems, prefer creating your own **ThreadPoolExecutor** instead of using the factory methods in Executors.
- Why? Because the **factory methods** use `unbounded queues`, which can lead to **OutOfMemoryError** under heavy load.

```java
    ExecutorService pool = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    2, 4, 60, TimeUnit.SECONDS,
    new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(100)
    );
```
