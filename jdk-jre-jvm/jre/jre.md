# JRE

### What it is:

- JVM + core Java libraries + supporting files.
- Allows you to run Java applications, but not develop them.

### Contains:

- JVM
- rt.jar (runtime classes)
- Other supporting files (fonts, properties, etc.)

### Main job:

- Provide everything the JVM needs to run programs.

### Analogy:

JRE is like the whole car ready to drive, but without the garage tools to build a new car.
If you only want to drive (run programs), JRE is enough.
