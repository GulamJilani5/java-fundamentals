# JDK

### What it is

JRE + development tools (compiler, debugger, JavaDoc, etc.).
Used to develop AND run Java programs.

### Contains:

- JRE
- javac (Java compiler)
- jdb (Java debugger)
- javap, jar, javadoc, etc.

### Main Job

- Compile .java → .class (bytecode).
- Run and debug programs.

### Analogy:

JDK is like the full workshop — it has the car (JRE), the engine (JVM), and all the tools to build and repair a car (compiler, debugger, etc.).
